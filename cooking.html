    <p><h3>Here are the basic steps to cleaning a fish</h3></em></p>
    <ul style="color: white; font-size: larger;">
        <li>
            To begin, rest the fish on the table or cutting board. Insert the knife tip into the fish's<br> belly near the anal opening and move the blade up along the belly, cutting to the head.
        </li>
        <li>
            Keep the knife blade shallow so you don't puncture the intestines.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Spread the body open and remove all of the entrails, locate the fish's anus and cut<br> this out in a "V" or notch shape.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some fish have a kidney by the backbone. Remove it by scraping it out with a spoon or your thumbnail.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rinse the cavity out with a good stream of water and wash the skin. Some fish have a <br>dark tissue lining the abdominal cavity that can be scraped off to prevent a strong, oily flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the head if you like, trout are often cooked with the head on.
        </li>
        <li>
            Clean your fish-cleaning table immediately, collect the guts, heads, and scales, and discard them properly.
        </li>
    </ul>
