<p>
    Here are some of my favorite quotes about fishing
    <div class=list>
        <q>A bad day of fishing is better than a good day of work.</q> – Author Unknown.
    </div>
    <div>
        <q>Fishing is much more than fish. It is the great occasion when we may return to the fine simplicity of our forefathers.</q>– Herbert Hoover
    </div> 
</p>


<p>According to an article on the mental benifits of fishing, <q>One of the biggest psychological benefits of fishing is that it allows anglers to focus <br>on the simple act of fishing.  You can let go of all your cares and worries, which in turn, gives you the opportunity to decompress and appreciate <br>the beauty and joy a day on the water affords.</q><cite>Alycia Downs 4/3/2020</cite></p>
