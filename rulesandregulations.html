<h1>Rules and Regulations</h1>

    <h3>
        One of the most important things to learn when you first start fishing are the rules and regulations <br>
        <br>
        Rules vary from state to state as well as region to region within Idaho
        <br>
        <br>
        If you click on the image to the left or <a href="https://idfg.idaho.gov/rules/fish" target="_blank">here</a> you will open a new page the Fish & Game fishing rules website
        <br>
        <br>
        You will need to understand what fish you can keep (some are protected) and how big they must be (there are limitations on minimums and maximums)
        <br>
        <br>
        The first thing you need to find is the region you are fishing in Idaho and then look up the specific rules for that area
        <br>

    <h3>
        There are other restrictions as well when fishing from a vessle (a boat or float): <br>
        • Some bodies of waters do not allow any floating vessles <br>
        • Some will allow boats but no motors or electric motors <br>
        • Some that allow electric motors may also require you to remove a gas motor if installed <br>
        • Make sure you are aware of the rules before putting a boat in the water
