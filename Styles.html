<h1>Styles of Fishing</h1>

<p><b>Any one who has watched the classic movie "A River Runs Through It" knows that <br>flyfishers are hardcore about their sport. But what is the difference <br>between fly fishing and other types of fishing?
<br> 
<br>
<br>And does it make a difference? It depends on who you ask...</b></p>


    <h2>The Intent Difference</h2>
      
        <img src="Fly-Fishing-vs-Spin-Fishing-1.jpg" style="width:25%"> 
        <p>
    <b>Fly Fishing – </b>The intent of fly fishing is to typically to fool a fish on any artificial fly that is made with animal pieces (feathers, hair, etc). The desire of most fly fisherman is to challenge themselves with a more difficult form of fishing and catch as many fish as possible during the experience. This idea of challenging yourself is a core idea of fly fishing. Arguably, it is more peaceful, and has been branded as a more pure way to catch a fish. Typically a trout will prefer insect imitations most times, and using lures with spin fishing just doesn’t give you as many options to catch fish across trout waters. Recently, fly fisherman have been trying to catch anything and everything on a fly rod, and are able to do so in most cases, so to say fly fishing is just for trout, is really false these days.
</p>
       
 <p>   Spin Fishing – is really meant to catch a lot of fish. It is likely a more versatile way to fish if you are going for different species aside from trout, and can have incredible results. Crankbaits, and other resistance lures that can only be used with spin rods, are an edge that spin fishing has over fly fishing any day. Though the skill of the angler often trumps any of the above mentioned, an equally matched spin fisherman vs a fly fisherman, the spin fisherman is probably the better bet if its not on a river for trout. The true intent of spin fishing is results driven and is arguably easier than fly fishing.
</p>  
  <h2>End of the Day</h2>
    <p>At the end of it all, which one is right for you? If you are looking to catch fish for dinner, and you’re near a lake, a spin rod is probably you best choice. However, if you’re looking for an experience with nature up on a stream or river in the mountains, then fly fishing, though more difficult to learn, is likely the best choice.
    
    The best way to find out is to get out and try each. Spin rods are very cheap and you can try it out for under $100 easily. Fly fishing you can get by under $300 during the summer, but perhaps borrowing from a friend is a better first option. There is a steep learning curve to fly fishing, but it really pays off as a lifelong sport when you learn.
</p> 
   <p> Isn’t it funny how our passions always seem to come out in every conversation? A simple game of hold em on party poker begins a spark in me to share the differences in fly fishing vs spin fishing simply because too many of my friends assume that they are pretty much the same thing.
    
    I hope you now understand that fly fishing is much different than spin fishing both in intent, gear used, and ability to fish certain waters. Get out there and try what your interests are, you may just find a new life long passion along the way.
